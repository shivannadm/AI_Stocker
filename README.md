# AI STOCKER

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a **high-frequency stock price prediction model** using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques to forecast stock prices. The model improves upon traditional daily predictions by offering **timely, fine-grained insights** to support more agile trading decisions.

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather day-based stock price data, such as open, high, low, and closed.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize data to ensure it is suitable for model input.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract key features like trading volume and volatility measures.
4. **Model Design**:
   - Implement LSTM to capture long-term dependencies.
   - Use CNN to identify short-term patterns and trends.
   - Combine CNN-LSTM for an integrated approach to enhance accuracy.
5. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Expected Outcome
The project will deliver an accurate, **real-time stock price prediction model** capable of day-wise predictions. Key benefits include:
- Improved prediction accuracy for both short-term and long-term market movements.
- Granular, daily insights to help investors make timely and informed trading decisions.
- Potential integration into trading platforms or advisory tools for practical applications.
